					<h2 id="Introduction"> Introduction</h2>
					<p> In the beginning, I want to highlight that in this text, I am using the word "ornaments" to
						refer to decoration in art, architecture, and design, as well as objects of applied art such as
						jewelry, ceramics, and other products of crafts; the term "Catholic Church" as an institution,
						not religion. This text's purpose is to unfold the visual identity of religious institutions,
						not to harm anyone's beliefs. </p>
					<p class="test-block" ,class="text-container"> Throughout history, art and architecture have
						sustained shifts in style,
						often leading to the transition and eventual loss of ornamentation. However, ornamentation
						remains deeply ingrained in the Catholic Church as a fundamental part of aesthetics, symbolism,
						and spiritual significance. Unlike secular movements such as modernism, brutalism, and
						constructivism, which have stripped away decorative elements

						in pursuit of minimalism or functionalism, Protest Churches focus on their relation with God

					<p class="test-block"> I argue that ornamentation is far more than a stylistic choice - it is a
						mechanism of
						perception, power, and identity. In art, architecture, and design, ornaments shape how we see
						and experience the world. They dictate hierarchies, reinforce cultural identities, and even
						control societal narratives. Removing ornamentation is not just an aesthetic shift but a more
						profound loss of individuality and cultural meaning. This study highlights the profound
						connection between ornamentation, identity, and power structures. I will explore how
						ornamentation functions as a marker of status, authority, and ideological control, visually
						reinforcing hierarchies and societal norms. By closely examining sacred objects used in the
						Catholic Church, I aim to uncover their rhetorical and semiotic significance, demonstrating how
						these details are not just embellishments but foundational elements of religious experience and
						institutional influence. </p>

					<h2 id="Preface">Preface</h2>

					<p> I grew up in Poland, a country where Catholic traditions are deeply rooted in daily life. From
						an
						early age, I was captivated by the rich ornamentation in churches—the ornamental altars,
						decorative
						vestments, and sacred objects used in rituals. Their visual power fascinated me, but I also
						sensed
						that they carried deeper meanings beyond their beauty.



						During my studies in graphic design, this fascination evolved into a more critical curiosity. I
						became interested in why ornamentation is so compelling and how it functions beyond decoration.
						This
						led me to question its symbolic significance, especially in religious contexts. I wanted to
						explore
						how sacred objects are designed not just to adorn but to communicate power and belief.



						This thesis is the result of that exploration. By studying key religious artifacts, I aim to
						uncover
						the mechanisms through which ornamentation influences meaning and reinforces structures of
						authority. </p>

						<p>Sacred ornamentation refers to decorative elements used in religious architecture, art, and
							objects
							that carry symbolic, spiritual, and cultural significance. These ornamental features are not

							aesthetic additions but are integral to the religious and ritualistic functions of sacred
							spaces.

					<p class="test-block">“The non-essential portion of a building or artifact”. This was close to the

						Steve Shriver writes in his paper "A Short History of Ornament and Its Relationship to Narrative
						Painting."
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">Steve Shriver's analysis of ornamentation in narrative painting expands on the
						idea that ornament is
						more than an aesthetic choice; it is a means of communication. Shriver acknowledges that
						ornamentation has been a narrative device throughout history, expressing meaning and
						strengthening
						cultural and ideological frameworks.
						<span class="footnote-wrapper">
							<a href="#footnote-3" class="footnote-ref">[3]</a>

							</span>
						</span>
						This aligns with the argument that sacred ornamentation in Catholicism is not simply decorative
						but
						a rhetorical tool that reinforces hierarchical structures, religious authority, and collective
						identity.
					</p>





					<p class="test-block">Loos's critique of ornamentation, as expressed in Ornament and Crime, reflects
						a modernist ideology
						that associates progress with simplicity, efficiency, and the removal of decorative excess. He
						argued that ornamentation was an outdated remnant of primitive cultures, an obstacle to
						society's
						functional and moral progress. While his perspective influenced modernist architecture and
						design,
						it stands in stark contrast to the persistent role of ornamentation in religious spaces,
						particularly within the Catholic Church, where decoration serves not only aesthetic purposes but
						also deep symbolic, spiritual, and communal functions. His statement was not only inappropriate
						but
						also deeply rooted in racial and gender biases. </p>




					<p class="test-block">"Loos was warning Austrians against identifying themselves with women's work,
						with the effeminized
						world of interior decoration. The figure of modernity for Loos, as for most writers of
						modernity,
						was emphatically male. Women and children were primitive, ignoble savages, as distinct from the
						heroic figure of modern man as primitive noble savages. The heroic male figure, energetic, cool,
						and
						detached, was the figure of architectural modernity. Architectural order here, the control of
						the
						senses, was first and foremost social control. </p>

					<p class="test-block"> For Loos, "the lack of ornament is a sign of intellectual power." […] But
						this intellectual power,
						which is presented here as above the "brutalities" of the "savage," seems in other passages to
						be an
						exclusively male attribute, as when Loos writes: "Ornament at the service of woman will last
						forever. […] The ornament of woman... answers, at bottom, that of the savage; it has an erotic
						meaning. The ornament, which for "the child, the Papuan, and the woman" is a "natural
						phenomenon,"
						for modern man is a "symptom of degeneration"

						</span>
					</p>





					<p class="test-block">Beatriz Colomina, in Sex, Lies, and Decoration: Adolf Loos and Gustav Klimt,
						highlights how Loos's
						rejection of ornament was implicated with a hierarchy and exclusionary. She argues that Loos
						positioned modernity as an entirely male domain, associating ornament with femininity,
						primitivism,
						and even degeneracy. According to Loos, "the lack of ornament is a sign of intellectual power,"
						yet
						this power, Colomina observes, is framed as an exclusively male attribute. He explicitly states
						that
						"ornament at the service of woman will last forever," likening female adornment to the
						decorative
						practices of so-called primitive cultures through reinforcing both racial and and gendered
						hierarchies. </p>

					<p class="test-block"> Not only was Loos's perspective rooted in racist assumptions about
						non-European cultures, but it was
						also profoundly sexist, as he explicitly associated ornamentation with femininity,
						irrationality,
						and intellectual inferiority, reinforcing the patriarchal belief that modernity was a purely
						masculine domain. </p>

					<p class="test-block">Unlike Loos's statement that ornament is an unnecessary luxury, I argue that
						ornamentation is an
						essential component of religious experience and institutional power in the Catholic Church. The
						elaborate establishment of altars, intricate vestments worn by clergy, and the use of gold and
						precious stones

						are not only ornamentations but intentional choices that visually reinforce the authority and
						sacredness of the Church. These objects act as intermediaries between the material and the
						divine,
						creating an atmosphere of reverence and awe.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">Further, the hierarchy within the Church is visually manifested through
						ornamentation. The Pope,
						bishops, and priests wear increasingly detailed vestments that represent rank and authority;
						these
						can be seen as symbol markers of ecclesiastical power. The use of rich materials, intricate
						embroidery, and specific colors in religious garments is not incidental; it separates the clergy
						from the laity, reinforcing a structured system of power maintained for centuries. </p>



					<p class="test-block text-container">In addition, the Church's use of ornamentation is deeply tied
						to its ability
						to shape cultural and

						highlighting theological differences regarding the role of visual magnificence in worship. While
						Protestant traditions often strip away ornamentation in favor of simplicity, reflecting their
						emphasis on direct spiritual connection without intermediaries, the Catholic Church embraces it
						as a
						means of sacred mediation.
					</p>

					<p class="test-block">Therefore, while Loos and modernist critics may have viewed ornamentation as a
						superficial excess,
						ornamentation's role within the Catholic Church demonstrates its functionality beyond
						aesthetics.

						Sacred ornamentation actively participates in religious rituals, shaping perceptions,
						reinforcing
						hierarchy, and maintaining institutional authority. It is not a random addition but an integral
						part
						of how the Church communicates power and sacredness, making it a crucial element of religious
						experience rather than an outdated relic of the past.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">This perspective questions the reductionist view that connects ornament with
						unnecessary
						extravagance, instead recognizing it as a tool to provide deeper meaning. The Catholic Church's
						ongoing use of ornamentation emphasizes its power to shape belief, influence perception, and
						sustain
						hierarchical structures, making it an essential aspect of religious practice. </p>



					<p class="test-block">Ornamentation in the Catholic Church is more than only a visual element. It is
						a carefully
						constructed system of visual hierarchy that reinforces religious authority and institutional
						order.

						Sacred objects, vestments, and architectural elements do not merely serve aesthetic purposes;
						they
						create an environment where power is communicated through material richness and structured
						symbolism. These elements ensure that ecclesiastical hierarchy is understood and deeply
						ingrained in
						the worship experience, shaping how individuals interact with religious authority on a conscious
						and
						subconscious level.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">Unlike secular movements that have moved toward minimalism, which we can
						observe based on art
						movements like cubism, suprematism, and constructivism, ornamentation operates as a form of
						visual
						persuasion, establishing a sense of majesty and sacred legitimacy. Whether through the ornate
						altars, detailed embroidery of clerical robes, or other accessories (like the fishermen's ring
						that
						I am going to introduce in the next chapter), ornamentation operates as a form of visual
						persuasion,
						establishing a sense of majesty and sacred legitimacy. </p>

						In the early history of Christianity, the ichthys symbol carried deep spiritual
						significance. It
						is believed that Christians used it as a secret sign to identify places of worship and
						fellow
						believers, especially during periods of persecution under the Roman Empire.
						The fisherman ring has historical and symbolic importance within the Catholic Church.
						Initially,
						it was used as a seal for important documents and letters. Over time, it became a powerful
						emblem of the papal office and authority. Upon the election of a new pope, a custom-made
						Fisherman's Ring is placed on his finger during the papal inauguration, symbolizing his role
						as
						the successor of Saint Peter. While the Fisherman's Ring is no longer utilized as a seal,
						every
						newly elected pope is presented with a unique ring as a representation of his episcopal
						authority and set hierarchy of the most important person in the church institution. In 1842,
						the
						practice of using the ring as a seal was discontinued and replaced with a stamp.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">Upon the pope's death, the ring is ceremonially destroyed by the
						Camerlengo (the official
						overseeing the Vatican between papacies). This ensures that no fraudulent documents are
						issued
						in the late pope's name. This event occurs before the cardinals officially commence the
						papal
						conclave to elect a new pope. The tradition of destroying a pope's ring was modified in 2013
						when Pope Benedict XVI resigned after serving since 2005. Instead of breaking the ring, the
						cardinal camerlengo used a chisel to engrave a deep cross on its upper part. A new ring is
						then
						made for the next pope, continuing the tradition.
						"Besides serving to adorn the body, rings have functioned as symbols of authority, fidelity,
						or
						social status."
						<span class="footnote-wrapper">
							<a href="#footnote-10" class="footnote-ref">[10]</a>

								Britannica,” n.d. https://www.britannica.com/art/signet-ring.)

							</span>
						</span>
						The exclusive use of an expensive metal such as gold in creating the Fisherman's Ring
						highlights
						its significance as a symbol of status, authority, and hierarchical distinction within the
						Catholic Church. Throughout history, gold has been associated with power, divinity, and
						wealth,
						often reserved for monarchs and religious leaders. Its durability and exclusives have made
						it a
						fitting material for objects of great spiritual and political importance. By crafting the
						Fisherman's Ring from gold or gold-plated metal, the Church underscores the supreme
						authority
						and sacred role of the pope, who is regarded as the direct successor to Saint Peter. The
						exclusivity of this ring further enhances its symbolic weight, as it is uniquely designed
						for
						each pope and cannot be worn by any other clergy member, regardless of their rank within the
						Church hierarchy.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block"> This tradition reflects a broader historical practice in which precious
						metals and gemstones
						were used to signify social standing and divine favor. Kings, emperors, and high priests
						across
						various civilizations have long adorned themselves with gold to assert their legitimacy and
						emphasize their connection to the sacred. In the context of the Catholic Church, where
						spiritual
						leadership is deeply intertwined with institutional structure, the Fisherman's Ring
						functions as
						both an emblem of continuity and an affirmation of the pope's outstanding status. Each
						ring's
						thorough craftsmanship and individualized nature reinforce the idea that the pontiff's
						authority
						is not simply administrative but divinely ordained.
						Additionally, the fact that this ring is produced by special order and is exclusively
						reserved
						for the pope serves as a powerful reminder of the rigid hierarchy within the Church. Unlike
						other ecclesiastical insignia, which may be shared among bishops and cardinals, the
						Fisherman's
						Ring belongs exclusively to the pope, further distinguishing him from all other members of
						the
						clergy. This distinction is not only ceremonial but also functional, as the ring once held
						an
						essential role in authenticating official papal documents. Even though it is no longer used
						as a
						seal, its ceremonial importance remains intact, reinforcing the pope's singular authority
						over
						the Catholic Church. </p>



					<p class="test-block"> Moreover, the ritual destruction of the Fisherman's Ring upon the pope's
						death or resignation
						further accentuates its exclusivity. By ensuring that no two popes share the same ring, this
						practice reinforces the idea that each pontiff holds a unique and unrepeatable position in
						the
						Church's history. The destruction of the ring also serves as a safeguard against fraudulent
						use,
						symbolizing the conclusion of one papal reign and the preparation for another. The
						modification
						of this ritual in 2013, when Pope Benedict XVI's ring was defaced rather than wholly
						destroyed,
						highlights the adaptability of tradition while maintaining its underlying principle—each
						pope's
						authority is singular and non-transferable. </p>



					<p class="test-block">Ultimately, the use of gold and the exclusivity of the Fisherman's Ring
						serve as a visual and
						material representation of the pope's supreme status within the Church. As an institution
						that
						values continuity, symbolism, and hierarchical structure, the Catholic Church ensures that
						the
						Fisherman's Ring remains a powerful testament to the enduring significance of the papal

					<p class="test-block">The tradition of kissing the pope's or a bishop's ring dates back to the
						Middle Ages, where it
						served as a powerful symbol of reverence and submission to ecclesiastical authority. This
						ritual
						reinforced the hierarchical structure of the Church, visually and physically demonstrating
						the
						power dynamics between clergy and laity. By kissing the ring, individuals acknowledged the
						superior status of the pope, bishops, and cardinals, affirming their place within the
						Church's
						rigid order. During the pontificate of Pius X (1903–1914), this act took on an additional
						spiritual dimension, as it was associated with the granting of an indulgence when performed
						for
						a cardinal or bishop. This further cemented the act as both a religious devotion and a means
						of
						reinforcing clerical supremacy. However, by the time of Paul VI (1963–1978), the Church was
						undergoing significant changes, and he pursued to modernize its structures and practices.

					<p class="test-block">His reforms to the system of indulgences and efforts to diminish gestures
						of hierarchical
						submission were part of a broader move to present the papacy as more pastoral and less
						monarchical. As a result, he eliminated many formalities that emphasized the Church's power
						structure, including the practice of kissing the pope's ring, hand, shoulder, cheek, or
						feet.
						This shift marked a departure from centuries-old traditions that had visually reinforced the
						clergy's authority over the faithful. </p>

						<p> The Holy Chalice, often referred to as the Holy Grail in certain Christian traditions,
							is
							believed to be the vessel Jesus used during the Last Supper to share wine with his
							Apostles,
							symbolizing his blood. The Synoptic Gospels recount how Jesus offered a cup of wine,
							calling it
							the covenant in his blood, an act that later became the foundation for the Christian
							sacrament
							of the Eucharist. This ritual, in which wine is consecrated and consumed from a chalice,
							remains
							a central practice in many Christian churches, signifying the believer's union with
							Christ and
							the rescue offered through his sacrifice. </p>

					<p class="test-block"> Over time, the significance of the Holy Chalice extended beyond its
						biblical origins, becoming
						intertwined with medieval legend. In the late 12th century, the French writer Robert de
						Boron
						connected the Holy Chalice to the pre-existing myth of the Holy Grail, a mystical object
						from
						Arthurian literature that was often depicted as a source of divine grace and enlightenment.
						This
						idea was further developed in later medieval works, including the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate)
						cycle, the Post-Vulgate cycle, and Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Through these
						stories,
						the Holy Grail evolved into a powerful symbol of spiritual quest and divine favor, capturing
						the
						imagination of generations.

					<p class="test-block"> Beyond its legendary associations, the Holy Chalice has also been

						as a key example. This artifact not only serves as a functional liturgical vessel but also
						reflects the broader themes of power, wealth, and divine authority in the medieval Catholic
						Church. Through its materials, craftsmanship, and historical context, the chalice becomes
						more
						than just an object used in religious ceremonies—it is a symbol of both spiritual and
						earthly
						majesty. By analyzing the way Abbot Suger transformed an ancient sardonyx cup into a richly
						decorated Christian relic, I will demonstrate how the rhetoric of the chalice communicates
						messages of sacred legitimacy, divine presence, and the Church's influence in shaping
						religious
						and artistic traditions.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block"> This remarkable chalice symbolizes the complex interplay of ancient
						craftsmanship, medieval
						religious devotion, and the rhetoric of wealth and power that has long been central to the
						Catholic Church's use of sacred objects. Originally carved in Alexandria, Egypt, the
						sardonyx
						cup showcases the skill of artisans who transformed raw stone into a refined vessel. The
						fluted
						patterns in the sardonyx, a rare and highly prized material, reflect both natural beauty and
						the
						human desire to shape the earth's treasures into objects of status and devotion. In its
						original
						context, this cup was a product of an advanced ancient civilization. However, its journey
						did
						not end in Egypt. Instead, like many prized artifacts, it was absorbed into the expanding
						influence of medieval Christendom, where its meaning was reshaped to serve a new purpose.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">By the 12th century, Abbot Suger of the abbey church of Saint-Denis, near
						Paris, sought to make
						his monastery a place of divine magnificence. For Abbot Suger, the visual majesty of
						liturgical
						objects was not merely ornamental but a crucial element of religious experience—a statement
						of
						God's presence made manifest through earthly riches. He commissioned goldsmiths to encase
						the
						ancient cup in gilded silver, an enhancement that elevated its status from an exotic
						artifact to
						a sacred vessel worthy of the Eucharist. The addition of pearls and gemstones reinforced the
						prevailing notion that divine power was best expressed through opulence, aligning with the
						Church's broader tradition of using material wealth to assert spiritual authority.

							</span>
						</span>
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">The base of the chalice further reflects this ideology, featuring a
						thoughtful image of Christ in
						a medallion, surrendered by the Greek letters Alpha and Omega—symbols of Christ as the
						beginning
						and the end. Through this transformation, an object once tied to the wealth of an ancient
						empire
						became a tool of Christian ritual, seamlessly integrating colonial impulses into sacred
						practice. The acquisition and repurposing of luxurious materials, often sourced from distant
						lands, was a trademark of medieval religious institutions, which framed their appropriation
						of
						global wealth as part of a divine mission. In this way, the chalice is more than a vessel
						for
						sacramental wine; it is an artifact of power, a product of cultural absorption, and a
						reflection
						of how material gloriousness has long been incorporated with religious authority in the
						Catholic
						Church. </p>



					<p class="test-block">In examining the Chalice of Abbot Suger of Saint-Denis, it becomes evident
						that ritual objects
						like chalices play a key role in establishing and reinforcing hierarchical structures within
						religious ceremonies. The privilege of handling such sacred vessels is traditionally
						reserved
						for ordained clergy, symbolizing their exclusive authority to perform sacred rituals and
						acting
						as a definite separation between the clergy and laity. This delineation not only emphasizes
						the
						sanctity of the rituals but also preserve the hierarchical order within the religious
						community.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block"> The exclusion of women from the clergy, particularly within the Catholic
						Church, has been
						historically justified through a combination of theological interpretations and cultural
						biases.
						One significant argument posited is that all twelve apostles were male. Pope Paul VI writes,
						"Jesus Christ did not call any women to become part of the Twelve. If he acted in this way,
						it
						was not in order to conform to the customs of his time, for his attitude towards women was
						quite
						different from that of his milieu, and he deliberately and courageously broke with it."

							</span>
						</span>
					</p>



					<p class="test-block"> The 1976 Declaration Inter Insigniores by the Sacred Congregation for the
						Doctrine of the Faith
						articulates this stance, asserting that the Church "does not consider herself authorized to
						admit women to priestly ordination"

						due to the example set by Christ in selecting only male apostles and the Church's
						longstanding
						tradition of a male-only priesthood. This document reflects the enduring influence of
						historical
						prejudices that have shaped theological justifications for excluding women from ordained
						ministry.
					</p>



					<p class="test-block">Furthermore, the material culture of the Church, including the use of
						ornate chalices and other
						ceremonial objects, reinforces these hierarchical structures. By restricting the use of such
						sacred objects to male clergy, the Church not only maintains its doctrinal positions but
						also
						eternalizes a visual and practical representation of gender-based exclusion. This
						intertwining
						of ritual practice and material culture serves to uphold traditional power dynamics and
						resist
						calls for inclusivity within the ecclesiastical hierarchy.

					<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

					<p class="test-block"> Throughout this thesis, I have explored the rhetoric of ornamentation in the
						Catholic Church,
						focusing on how sacred objects function beyond their aesthetic appeal. By analysing artefacts
						such
						as the Chalice of Abbot Suger of Saint-Denis and the Fisherman’s Ring, I have demonstrated that
						ornamentation is not merely decorative but serves as a powerful tool for reinforcing religious
						authority, shaping identity, and communicating institutional power. These objects, through their
						material richness and intricate craftsmanship, act as visual and symbolic markers of hierarchy,
						divine presence, and theological significance. </p>

					<p class="test-block">The study of ornamentation within religious contexts reveals a broader
						understanding of how visual
						language influences human perception and societal structures. The Catholic Church has long
						utilised
						ornamentation to create an atmosphere of reverence, establish distinctions between clergy and
						laity,
						and reinforce its institutional legitimacy. Unlike secular artistic movements that have moved
						toward
						minimalism, the Church continues to keep traditions and embrace ornament as a means of sacred
						communication, proving its enduring significance in religious practice. </p>

					<p class="test-block"> However, ornamentation does not operate in a vaca voidof spiritual
						symbolism—it also functions as a
						medium of manipulation and exclusion. Sacred objects laden with gold, gemstones, and elaborate
						designs not only command awe but often uphold systems of racial and gender discrimination. As
						Beatriz Colomina and other scholars have argued, the rhetoric of ornamentation has historically
						excluded women from superiority, casting ornamentation as inherently feminine, erotic, or
						primitive.
						Similarly, the repurposing of luxury materials from colonized or non-European cultures into
						Christian objects of worship reflects a dynamic of cultural appropriation, where ornamentation
						becomes a tool for reinforcing imperial dominance under the impression of sanctity. </p>

					<p class="test-block">These visual languages of power do more than reflect theology—they construct
						it. By controlling who
						may handle sacred objects and participate in ornamented rituals, the Church sustains systems
						that
						privilege male, Eurocentric authority. Thus, the aesthetic grandeur of ornamentation often masks
						underlying ideologies of control and exclusion. These artefacts are not only vessels of divine
						association but instruments through which religious experience is shaped, directed, and, at
						times,
						manipulated to uphold a specific vision of order. </p>


					<p class="test-block">Ultimately, ornamentation in the Catholic Church is far more than an
						embellishment—it is a mechanism
						that shapes belief, reinforces hierarchy, and sustains cultural traditions. By examining these
						sacred objects, we gain insight into the ways in which visual elements contribute to religious
						experience and institutional influence. </p>

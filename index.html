					<p> Ornamentation has been a powerful tool in shaping societal structures and identities throughout

					<h4 id="Introduction"> Introduction</h2>
						<p> In the beginning, I want to highlight that in this text, I am using the word "ornaments" to
							refer to decoration in art, architecture, and design, as well as objects of applied art such
							as jewellery, ceramics, and other products of crafts; the term "Catholic Church" as an
							institution, not religion. This text's purpose is to unfold the visual identity of religious
							institutions, not to harm anyone's beliefs.</p>
						<p class="text-container"> Throughout history, art and architecture have sustained shifts in
							style, often leading to the transition and eventual loss of ornamentation. However,
							ornamentation remains deeply ingrained in the Catholic Church as a fundamental part of
							aesthetics, symbolism, and spiritual significance. Unlike secular movements such as

							in pursuit of minimalism or functionalism, Protest Churches focus on their relation with God
							rather than the distraction of rich ornamentation. Catholic spaces continue to embrace

						<p> I argue that ornamentation is far more than a stylistic choice - it is a mechanism of
							perception, power, and identity. In art, architecture, and design, ornaments shape how we
							see and experience the world. They dictate hierarchies, reinforce cultural identities, and
							even control societal narratives. Removing ornamentation is not just an aesthetic shift but
							a more profound loss of individuality and cultural meaning. This study highlights the
							profound connection between ornamentation, identity, and power structures. I will explore
							how ornamentation functions as a marker of status, authority, and ideological control,
							visually reinforcing hierarchies and societal norms. By closely examining sacred objects
							used in the Catholic Church, I aim to uncover their rhetorical and semiotic significance,
							demonstrating how these details are not just embellishments but foundational elements of
							religious experience and institutional influence.</p>

					<h2 id="Preface">Preface</h2>

					<p> I grew up in Poland, a country where Catholic traditions are deeply rooted into daily life. From
						an early age, I was captivated by the rich ornamentation in churches—the ornamental altars,
						complicated vestments, and sacred objects used in rituals. Their visual power fascinated me, but
						I also sensed that they carried deeper meanings beyond their beauty.</p>
					<p>During my studies in graphic design, this fascination evolved into a more critical curiosity. I
						became interested in why ornamentation is so compelling and how it functions beyond decoration.
						This led me to question its symbolic significance, especially in religious contexts where it
						plays a crucial role in shaping perception, authority, and identity. I wanted to explore how
						sacred objects are designed not just to adorn but to communicate power and belief.</p>
					<p>This thesis is the result of that exploration. By studying key religious artefacts, I aim to
						uncover the mechanisms through which ornamentation influences meaning and reinforces structures
						of authority.</p>

					<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1: Loos and loos of ornaments</h2>

					<p> Sacred ornamentation refers to decorative elements used in religious architecture, art and
						objects that carry symbolic, spiritual, and cultural significance. These ornamental features are
						not only aesthetic additions but are integral to the religious and ritualistic functions of
						sacred spaces. They perform to improve the experience of the divine and reflect the spiritual
						hierarchy, religious beliefs, and the power structures inherent in religious practices. Religion
						ornaments often aim to connect the physical space with the divine, transforming an ordinary
						space into a sacred one. </p>
					<p> „The non-essential portion of a building or artefact'. This was close to the opinion put forth a
						century ago by Loos in his essay "Ornament and Crime"

						Steve Shriver writes in his paper "A Short History of Ornament and Its Relationship to Narrative
						Painting."
					</p>
					<p> Loos's critique of ornamentation, as expressed in Ornament and Crime, reflects a modernist
						ideology that associates progress with simplicity, efficiency, and the removal of decorative
						excess. He argued that ornamentation was an outdated remains, an obstacle to society's
						functional and moral progress. While his perspective influenced modernist architecture and
						design, it simply contrasts the persistent role of ornamentation in religious spaces,
						particularly within the Catholic Church.</p>
					<p> Steve Shriver's analysis of ornamentation in narrative painting expands on the idea that
						ornament is more than an aesthetic choice; it is a means of communication. Shriver acknowledges
						that ornamentation has been a narrative device throughout history, expressing meaning and
						strengthening cultural and ideological frameworks.

						This aligns with the argument that sacred ornamentation in Catholicism is not simply decorative
						but a rhetorical tool that reinforces hierarchical structures, religious authority, and
						collective identity.
					</p>
					<p class="text-container"> Unlike Loos's statement that ornament is an unnecessary luxury, I argue
						that ornamentation is an essential component of religious experience and institutional power in
						the Catholic Church. The elaborate establishment of altars, intricate vestments worn by clergy,
						and the use of gold and precious stones

						</span>
						are not only ornamentations but intentional choices that visually reinforce the authority and
						sacredness of the Church. These objects act as intermediaries between the material and the
						divine, creating an atmosphere of reverence and awe.
					</p>
					<p> Additionally, the hierarchy within the Church is visually manifested through ornamentation. The
						Pope, bishops, and priests wear increasingly detailed vestments that represent rank and
						authority; these can be seen as symbol markers of ecclesiastical power. The use of rich
						materials, intricate embroidery, and specific colours in religious garments is not incidental;
						it separates the clergy from the laity, reinforcing a structured system of power maintained for
						centuries. </p>
					<p>In addition, the Church's use of ornamentation is deeply tied to its ability to shape cultural
						and social identities. The outstanding aesthetics of Catholic spaces

						, highlighting theological differences regarding the role of visual magnificence in worship.
						While Protestant traditions often strip away ornamentation in favour of simplicity, reflecting
						their emphasis on direct spiritual connection without intermediaries, the Catholic Church
						embraces it as a means of sacred mediation.
						Therefore, while Loos and modernist critics may have viewed ornamentation as a superficial
						excess, ornamentation's role within the Catholic Church demonstrates its functionality beyond
						aesthetics.

						Sacred ornamentation actively participates in religious rituals, shaping perceptions,
						reinforcing hierarchy, and maintaining institutional authority. It is not a random addition but
						an integral part of how the Church communicates power and sacredness, making it a crucial
						element of religious experience rather than an outdated relic of the past.
					</p>
					<p> This perspective questions the reductionist view that connects ornament with unnecessary
						extravagance, instead recognising it as a tool to provide meaning, identity, and power. The
						Catholic Church's ongoing use of ornamentation emphasises its power to shape belief, influence
						perception, and sustain hierarchical structures, making it an essential aspect of religious
						practice.</p>
					<p> Ornamentation in the Catholic Church is more than solely a visual element. It is a carefully
						constructed system of visual hierarchy that reinforces religious authority and institutional
						order

						</span>

						. Sacred objects, vestments, and architectural elements do not merely serve aesthetic purposes;
						they create an environment where power is communicated through material richness and structured
						symbolism. These elements ensure that ecclesiastical hierarchy is understood and deeply
						ingrained in the worship experience, shaping how individuals interact with religious authority
						on a conscious and subconscious level.
					</p>
					<p> Unlike secular movements that have moved toward minimalism, which we can observe based on art
						movements like cubism, suprematism, and constructivism. Whether through the ornate altars the
						detailed embroidery of clerical robes, or other accessories (like fishermen ring that I am gonna
						introduce in next chapter) ornamentation operates as a form of visual persuasion, establishing a
						sense of majesty and sacred legitimacy.</p>

					</p>
					<p> In the early history of Christianity, the ichthys symbol carried deep spiritual significance. It
						is believed that Christians used it as a secret sign to identify places of worship and fellow
						believers, especially during periods of persecution under the Roman Empire.</p>
					<p> This ring has deep historical and symbolic significance within the Catholic Church. Initially,
						it was used as a seal for important documents and letters.</p>
					<p> Over time, it became a powerful emblem of the papal office and authority. Upon the election of a
						new pope, a custom-made Fisherman's Ring is placed on his finger during the papal inauguration,
						symbolising his role as the successor of Saint Peter. While the Fisherman's Ring is no longer
						utilised as a seal, every newly elected pope is presented with a unique ring as a representation
						of his episcopal authority and set hierarchy of the most important person in the church
						institution. In 1842, the practice of using the ring as a seal was discontinued and replaced
						with a stamp.</p>
					<p> Upon the pope's death, the ring is ceremonially destroyed by the Camerlengo (the official
						overseeing the Vatican between papacies). This ensures that no fraudulent documents are issued
						in the late pope's name. This event occurs before the cardinals officially commence the papal
						conclave to elect a new pope. The tradition of destroying a pope's ring was modified in 2013
						when Pope Benedict XVI resigned after serving since 2005. Instead of breaking the ring, the
						cardinal camerlengo used a chisel to engrave a deep cross on its upper part. A new ring is then
						made for the next pope, continuing the tradition.</p>
					<p> "Besides serving to adorn the body, rings have functioned as symbols of authority, fidelity, or
						social status."

						</span>
					</p>
					<p> The exclusive use of an expensive metal such as gold in creating the Fisherman's Ring highlights
						its significance as a symbol of status, authority, and hierarchical distinction within the
						Catholic Church. Throughout history, gold has been associated with power, divinity, and wealth,
						often reserved for monarchs and religious leaders. Its durability and exclusives have made it a
						fitting material for objects of great spiritual and political importance. By crafting the
						Fisherman's Ring from gold or gold-plated metal, the Church underscores the supreme authority
						and sacred role of the pope, who is regarded as the direct successor to Saint Peter. The
						exclusivity of this ring further enhances its symbolic weight, as it is uniquely designed for
						each pope and cannot be worn by any other clergy member, regardless of their rank within the
						Church hierarchy.</p>
					<p> This tradition reflects a broader historical practice in which precious metals and gemstones
						were used to signify social standing and divine favour. Kings, emperors, and high priests across
						various civilisations have long adorned themselves with gold to assert their legitimacy and
						emphasise their connection to the sacred. In the context of the Catholic Church, where spiritual
						leadership is deeply intertwined with institutional structure, the Fisherman's Ring functions as
						both an emblem of continuity and an affirmation of the pope's outstanding status. The thorough
						craftsmanship and individualised nature of each ring reinforce the idea that the pontiff's
						authority is not simply administrative but divinely ordained.</p>
					<p> Additionally, the fact that this ring is produced by special order and is exclusively reserved
						for the pope serves as a powerful reminder of the rigid hierarchy within the Church. Unlike
						other ecclesiastical insignia, which may be shared among bishops and cardinals, the Fisherman's
						Ring belongs solely to the reigning pope, further distinguishing him from all other members of
						the clergy. This distinction is not only ceremonial but also functional, as the ring once held
						an essential role in authenticating official papal documents. Even though it is no longer used
						as a seal, its ceremonial importance remains intact, reinforcing the pope's singular authority
						over the Catholic Church.</p>
					<p>Moreover, the ritual destruction of the Fisherman's Ring upon the pope's death or resignation
						further accentuates its exclusivity. By ensuring that no two popes share the same ring, this
						practice reinforces the idea that each pontiff holds a unique and unrepeatable position in the
						Church's history. The destruction of the ring also serves as a safeguard against fraudulent use,
						symbolising the conclusion of one papal reign and the preparation for another. The modification
						of this ritual in 2013, when Pope Benedict XVI's ring was defaced rather than wholly destroyed,
						highlights the adaptability of tradition while maintaining its underlying principle—each pope's
						authority is singular and non-transferable.</p>
					<p> Ultimately, the use of gold and the exclusivity of the Fisherman's Ring serve as a visual and
						material representation of the pope's supreme status within the Church. As an institution that
						values continuity, symbolism, and hierarchical structure, the Catholic Church ensures that the
						Fisherman's Ring remains a powerful testament to the enduring significance of the papal office.
						The ring is not only a piece of jewellery but a deeply embedded symbol of religious authority,
						reflecting centuries of tradition and reinforcing the unique and exalted position of the pope in
						the spiritual and institutional framework of the Church.</p>
					<p> The tradition of kissing the pope's or a bishop's ring dates back to the Middle Ages, where it
						served as a powerful symbol of reverence and submission to ecclesiastical authority. This ritual
						reinforced the hierarchical structure of the Church, visually and physically demonstrating the
						power dynamics between clergy and laity. By kissing the ring, individuals acknowledged the
						superior status of the pope, bishops, and cardinals, affirming their place within the Church's
						rigid order. During the pontificate of Pius X (1903–1914), this act took on an additional
						spiritual dimension, as it was associated with the granting of an indulgence when performed for
						a cardinal or bishop. This further cemented the act as both a religious devotion and a means of
						reinforcing clerical supremacy. However, by the time of Paul VI (1963–1978), the Church was
						undergoing significant changes, and he sought to modernise its structures and practices.

					</p>
					<p> His reforms to the system of indulgences and efforts to diminish gestures of hierarchical
						submission were part of a broader move to present the papacy as more pastoral and less
						monarchical. As a result, he eliminated many formalities that emphasised the power structure of
						the Church, including the practice of kissing the pope's ring, hand, shoulder, cheek, or feet.
						This shift marked a departure from centuries-old traditions that had visually reinforced the
						authority of the clergy over the faithful. </p>

						<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3 : The Chalice of Symbol</h2>
						<p> The Holy Chalice, often referred to as the Holy Grail in certain Christian traditions, is
							believed to be the vessel Jesus used during the Last Supper to share wine with his Apostles,
							symbolising his blood. The Synoptic Gospels recount how Jesus offered a cup of wine, calling
							it the covenant in his blood, an act that later became the foundation for the Christian
							sacrament of the Eucharist. This ritual, in which wine is consecrated and consumed from a
							chalice, remains a central practice in many Christian churches, signifying the believer's
							union with Christ and the redemption offered through his sacrifice. </p>
					</div>
					<p> Over time, the significance of the Holy Chalice extended beyond its biblical origins, becoming
						intertwined with medieval legend. In the late 12th century, the French writer Robert de Boron
						connected the Holy Chalice to the pre-existing myth of the Holy Grail, a mystical object from
						Arthurian literature that was often depicted as a source of divine grace and enlightenment. This
						idea was further developed in later medieval works, including the Lancelot-Grail (Vulgate)
						cycle, the Post-Vulgate cycle, and Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. Through these stories,
						the Holy Grail evolved into a powerful symbol of spiritual quest and divine favour, capturing
						the imagination of generations.

					<p> Beyond its legendary associations, the Holy Chalice has also been venerated as a tangible relic.

						sacred legitimacy, divine presence, and the Church's influence in shaping religious and artistic
						traditions.
					</p>
					<p> This remarkable chalice embodies the complex interplay of ancient craftsmanship, medieval
						religious devotion, and the rhetoric of wealth and power that has long been central to the
						Catholic Church's use of sacred objects. Originally carved in Alexandria, Egypt, the sardonyx
						cup showcases the skill of artisans who transformed raw stone into a refined vessel. The fluted
						patterns in the sardonyx, a rare and highly prized material, reflect both natural beauty and the
						human desire to shape the earth's treasures into objects of status and reverence. In its
						original context, this cup was a product of an advanced ancient civilisation. However, its
						journey did not end in Egypt.
						Instead, like many prized artefacts, it was absorbed into the expanding influence of medieval
						Christendom, where its meaning was reshaped to serve a new purpose. </p>
					<p> By the 12th century, Abbot Suger of the abbey church of Saint-Denis, near Paris, sought to make
						his monastery a place of divine magnificence. For Abbot Suger, the visual majesty of liturgical
						objects was not merely ornamental but a crucial element of religious experience—a statement of
						God's presence made manifest through earthly riches. He commissioned goldsmiths to encase the
						ancient cup in gilded silver, an enhancement that elevated its status from an exotic artefact to
						a sacred vessel worthy of the Eucharist. The addition of pearls and gemstones reinforced the
						prevailing notion that divine power was best expressed through opulence, aligning with the
						Church's broader tradition of using material wealth to assert spiritual authority.

					</p>
					<p>The base of the chalice further reflects this ideology, featuring a solemn image of Christ in a
						medallion, flanked by the Greek letters Alpha and Omega—symbols of Christ as the beginning and
						the end. Through this transformation, an object once tied to the wealth of an ancient empire
						became a tool of Christian ritual, seamlessly integrating colonial impulses into sacred
						practice. The acquisition and repurposing of luxurious materials, often sourced from distant
						lands, was a hallmark of medieval religious institutions, which framed their appropriation of
						global wealth as part of a divine mission. In this way, the chalice is more than a vessel for
						sacramental wine; it is an artefact of power, a product of cultural absorption, and a reflection
						of how material grandeur has long been interwoven with religious authority in the Catholic
						Church. </p>

					<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
					<p> Throughout this thesis, I have explored the rhetoric of ornamentation in the Catholic Church,
						focusing on how sacred objects function beyond their aesthetic appeal. By analysing artefacts
						such as the Chalice of Abbot Suger of Saint-Denis and the Fisherman's Ring, I have demonstrated
						that ornamentation is not merely decorative but serves as a powerful tool for reinforcing
						religious authority, shaping identity, and communicating institutional power. These objects,
						through their material richness and intricate craftsmanship, act as visual and symbolic markers
						of hierarchy, divine presence, and theological significance.</p>
					<p> The study of ornamentation within religious contexts reveals a broader understanding of how
						visual language influences human perception and societal structures. The Catholic Church has
						long utilised ornamentation to create an atmosphere of reverence, establish distinctions between
						clergy and laity, and reinforce its institutional legitimacy. Unlike secular artistic movements
						that have moved toward minimalism, the Church continues to keep traditions and embrace ornament
						as a means of sacred communication, proving its enduring significance in religious practice.
					</p>
					<p> Moreover, this research highlights the intersection of material culture, theology, and power.
						The use of gold, gemstones, and elaborate design in sacred objects is not incidental—it reflects
						a carefully constructed system of visual persuasion. These objects command attention, evoke awe,
						and establish a substantial connection between the material and the divine. Their continued
						presence in religious rituals underscores the lasting impact of ornamentation on faith and
						authority. </p>
					<p> Ultimately, ornamentation in the Catholic Church is far more than an embellishment—it is a
						mechanism that shapes belief, reinforces hierarchy, and sustains cultural traditions. By
						examining these sacred objects, we gain insight into the ways in which visual elements
						contribute to religious experience and institutional influence. </p>
